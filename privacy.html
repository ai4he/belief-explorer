<h1>Privacy Policy for Belief Explorer</h1>
<p><em>Effective Date: July, 2025</em></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Belief Explorer (“Belief Explorer,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy.  This Privacy Policy explains our commitment to maintaining a service that does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal information from visitors to this website or users of our related services (collectively, the “Services”).  By accessing or using the Services, you acknowledge that Belief Explorer operates on a “no-data-collection” basis as described below.</p>

<h2>2. No Information Collected</h2>
<p>Belief Explorer does not request, collect, log, or store any personally identifiable information (PII) or anonymized usage data.  We do not solicit account registration, nor do we provide forms, surveys, comment sections, or any other interface through which you might submit personal data.  In addition, we do not log IP addresses, device identifiers, browser characteristics, or clickstream details beyond the brief, transient memory necessary to serve the requested webpage to your browser.</p>

<h2>3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>Belief Explorer does not use cookies, web beacons, pixels, local-storage objects, or any comparable tracking technology—either first-party or third-party.  Because no such technologies are employed, there is no need for a cookie banner or settings panel, and your browser’s “Do Not Track” preference is inherently honored.</p>

<h2>4. Information Sharing</h2>
<p>Because we do not collect or retain any information, Belief Explorer has no data to disclose, sell, rent, or otherwise share with third parties.  We do not partner with advertising networks, analytics providers, or any other external service that would require or enable data transfer.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention and Security</h2>
<p>As no personal data is stored, Belief Explorer maintains no data retention schedule.  Temporary technical logs reside only in volatile server memory long enough to complete a page request, after which they are automatically discarded.  Consequently, traditional security measures for stored personal information are unnecessary; however, we still employ industry-standard safeguards to protect the integrity and availability of the Services themselves.</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<p>Because Belief Explorer does not hold any personal information about you, requests to access, correct, delete, or port data are not applicable.  If you have questions about our zero-data-collection approach, you may contact us at the address below.</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Belief Explorer is designed for a general audience and does not knowingly collect information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age (or the age defined by local law).  Our strict no-collection policy eliminates the possibility of inadvertently gathering children’s personal data.</p>

<h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
<p>The Services are hosted in the United States.  Because we do not gather any data, international transfer mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses are not required; nevertheless, visitors from outside the United States should be aware that their page requests are routed through servers located in the U.S.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time—for example, if the scope of the Services evolves.  Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised “Effective Date.”  If future updates were ever to introduce data collection, we would provide conspicuous advance notice and an opportunity to review the revised policy before it takes effect.</p>

<h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us:</p>
